# zomato clone 
Creating a Zomato clone involves several key components:

1. **HTML**: This is used to structure the content of your web pages, including elements like the navigation bar, search bar, restaurant listings, and individual restaurant details.

2. **CSS**: CSS is used for styling the HTML elements to make the web pages visually appealing and responsive. It includes defining layouts, colors, fonts, and other visual properties.

3. **JavaScript**: JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the web pages. This includes features like search functionality, filtering restaurant listings, handling user reviews, and dynamically updating the content without reloading the page.

4. **MySQL**: MySQL is used as the backend database to store and manage data related to restaurants, user reviews, user details, and other relevant information. It involves designing the database schema and writing SQL queries to interact with the database.
